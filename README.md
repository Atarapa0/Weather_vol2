# weather_vol2

A new Weather application vol.2 Flutter project.

Hello everyone! I’d like to share the weather application I developed using Flutter. 🌤️ The app fetches real-time weather data through API integration and presents it with a user-friendly interface. 📊 Key features include:
Live weather updates: Displays maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity levels, and weather descriptions.
Weekly forecast: Provides a graphical representation of the upcoming days’ weather conditions.
Theme customization: Designed with a modern and aesthetic look, utilizing the flexibility of Flutter widgets.
This small project was a great opportunity to enhance my Flutter skills while highlighting the importance of customization and functionality in app design. 🚀 Up next, I plan to develop another weather app with different features and designs! 🌍 This will allow me to explore new approaches and further refine my expertise in Flutter.
If you have any questions or suggestions, I’d be happy to hear them! 😊
